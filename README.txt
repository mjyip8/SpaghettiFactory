I managed to complete all the tasks for the assignment. I attempted to create a QuadTree, but after several failed attempts, I decided to cut my losses. I also implemented friction during the impulse calculations, but I found that while it made the simulation more realistic, I got more overlaps sooner. My most successful attempt is far from realistic. The spaghetti is a little bouncy.}
